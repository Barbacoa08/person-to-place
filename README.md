# Person to Place

Are you sick to death of trying to remember who lives where and what time it is there? Me too.

## dev notes

- all icons created from my Calvin face image via: `pnpm tauri icon ./src-tauri/icons/app-icon.png`
  - [docs here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/icons/#command-usage)
- run app dev: `pnpm tauri dev`
- run web dev: `pnpm dev`

## other notes

_After_ starting work on this project, I found [Clocker](https://github.com/n0shake/clocker) for Mac. Clocker solves a similar problem, and is free, but is Mac only and doesn't have a "notes" feature or as much customization. If what you need is a simple name-to-time on a Mac, Clocker may be a better product for you. If you need slightly more extensive notes, a larger display, and want more customization options, Person to Place may be a better product for you.
