# Person to Place

Are you sick to death of trying to remember who lives where and what time it is there? Me too.

## dev notes

## other notes

_After_ starting work on this project, I found [Clocker](https://github.com/n0shake/clocker) for Mac. Clocker solves a similar problem, and is free, but is Mac only and doesn't have a "notes" feature or as much customization. If what you need is a simple name-to-time on a Mac, Clocker may be a better product for you. If you need slightly more extensive notes, a larger display, and want more customization options, Person to Place may be a better product for you.

The app images were generated by "[Stable Doodle](https://clipdrop.co/stable-doodle)"

Data for the app is stored at:

- Mac: `/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/com.tauri.dev/.settings.dat`
- PC: unknown
