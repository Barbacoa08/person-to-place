# Person to Place

Are you sick to death of trying to remember who lives where and what time it is there? Me too.

## features and functionality examples

The app is fully local. When you first load it up you will be see the following message, "No preferences found, using default preferences" which just means that everything is turned on.

Tha app has full CRUD functionality.

The app allows searching for a person, place, or timezone independant of if those options are shown.

Finally, the app has a wide range of preferences to choose from, such as what columns to show, date and time format, and more.

## other notes

_After_ starting work on this project, I found [Clocker](https://github.com/n0shake/clocker) for Mac. Clocker solves a similar problem, and is free, but is Mac only and doesn't have a "notes" feature or as much customization. If what you need is a simple name-to-time on a Mac, Clocker may be a better product for you. If you need slightly more extensive notes, a larger display, and want more customization options, Person to Place may be a better product for you.

The app images were generated by "[Stable Doodle](https://clipdrop.co/stable-doodle)"

Data for the app is stored at:

- Mac: `/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/com.tauri.dev/.settings.dat`
- PC: unknown
